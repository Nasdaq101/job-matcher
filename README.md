# LinkedIn Job Matcher - RAG System

A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that provides personalized job recommendations from LinkedIn data based on user queries, skills, and location preferences.

## üéØ Project Overview

This application helps job seekers find relevant LinkedIn opportunities by:
- Matching users' skills, experience, and location preferences to job postings
- Highlighting factors influencing job relevance (skills match, industry trends, etc.)
- Providing explainable recommendations with proper citations to source data

## üíª Development(localhost)

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/CongYidan/linkedin-rag-job-matcher.git
cd linkedin-rag-job-matcher

# create .env file and add your Google API key, replace "your-google-api-key" with your actual key
echo "GOOGLE_API_KEY='your-google-api-key'" >> .env

# clean up data
bash scripts/clean_up.sh

# setup dependencies and database
bash scripts/setup.sh 

# start application end to end
bash scripts/run.sh 

# stop application
bash scripts/stop_app.sh

```

## üíª Development(dockerization)

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/CongYidan/linkedin-rag-job-matcher.git
cd linkedin-rag-job-matcher

# create .env file and add your Google API key, replace "your-google-api-key" with your actual key
echo "GOOGLE_API_KEY='your-google-api-key'" >> .env

# build docker
docker build -f Dockerfile -t linkedin-rag-job-matcher:latest .

# start docker container
docker run --rm -it -p 8000:8000 -p 8501:8501 linkedin-rag-job-matcher:latest

```

## üåü Key Features

- **Advanced Query Processing**: Handles natural language questions about job opportunities
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Matches jobs based on user skills and location preferences
- **Semantic Search**: Goes beyond keyword matching with embedding-based retrieval
- **Explainable Results**: Highlights why specific jobs match user requirements
- **Citation Support**: References original job listing sources for verification
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Streamlined experience for job exploration

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Architecture

### Data Pipeline
- **Data Source**: LinkedIn Job Postings dataset (2023-2024) from Kaggle
- **Preprocessing**: Cleaning, normalization, and structured extraction of job features
- **Vectorization**: Sentence-BERT embeddings using 'TechWolf/JobBERT-v2' model for semantic matching
- **Storage**: Vector database (ChromaDB) for efficient similarity search
- **Sample Data**: Pre-processed sample data included in the repository

### RAG System Components
- **Retriever**: Embedding-based retrieval with sentence-window approach
- **Context Processing**: Auto-merging of relevant chunks from same job posting
- **Generator**: Google Vertex AI-Gemini for synthesizing job recommendations
- **Citations**: Linking recommendations to original LinkedIn postings

### LLM Integration
- Google Vertex AI-Gemini for response generation
- Advanced context processing for relevant job recommendations
- Natural language explanations of job matches

## üöÄ Deployment

This application will be deployed on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) to meet the project requirements. The deployment strategy includes:

- Containerized application hosting (Google Cloud Run)
- Data storage solutions (Google Cloud Storage Buckets)
- Google Vertex AI for LLM integration

## üöÄ Usage

1. Access the web interface at `http://localhost:8501`
2. Enter your query (e.g., "Remote software engineer job in San Francisco")
3. Optionally specify additional filters (skills, location)
4. Review personalized job recommendations with explanation of matches

## üìä Evaluation Metrics

Our system is evaluated using the RAG triad of metrics:
- **Context Relevance**: How well retrieved job descriptions match user profiles
- **Groundedness**: Ensuring recommendations strictly reference LinkedIn data
- **Answer Relevance**: Quality of final job recommendations for user needs
